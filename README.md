# 👋 Hi, I'm retr0

I'm a **Site Reliability Engineer** who loves exploring where software meets hardware. My work spans cloud infrastructure, automation, and cybersecurity all the way down to microcontrollers, retro hardware, and digital fabrication. Driven by curiosity, I focus on building resilient, adaptable systems—and sharing the experiments I create along the way.  

> **Note:** This account (`@retrocrypticghost`) is my public-facing space for open-source projects and personal tinkering—helping me maintain a clear work/life boundary.

## 🧠 Interests

- **Cybersecurity**: Systems hardening, threat modeling, and automation-driven defense.  
- **Generative AI & LLM Research**: Language models, agent frameworks, and prompt optimization.  
- **Automation & Infrastructure**: From CI/CD pipelines to full system provisioning.  
- **Open Source Advocacy**: Supporting FOSS tools and community-driven development.  
- **Embedded Systems & Microcontrollers**: Low-level programming, prototyping, and hardware hacking.  
- **3D Printing & Digital Fabrication**: Designing and printing functional parts (Prusa MK3S, Ender Pro series).  

> I thrive at the intersection of software, hardware, and fabrication—where code meets circuits, and ideas become things.
