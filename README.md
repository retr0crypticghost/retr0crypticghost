# 👋 Hi, I'm retr0

I’m a **Site Reliability Engineer** with an interest in how software and hardware fit together. My work covers cloud infrastructure, automation, and security, as well as side projects with microcontrollers, retro computing, and digital fabrication.  

This account (`@retr0crypticghost`) is where I share open-source experiments, personal projects, and templates that others may find useful. It’s separate from my professional work to keep a clear boundary.

## 🧠 Areas of Interest
- **Security & Reliability:** hardening systems, improving logging, and automating safeguards  
- **Infrastructure & Automation:** CI/CD pipelines, GitOps workflows, reproducible environments  
- **Programming & Languages:** Python, C/C++, learning Rust and Lua  
- **Embedded & Retro:** experimenting with microcontrollers and vintage hardware  
- **Digital Fabrication:** practical 3D printing and small-scale prototyping  

---

## 🚧 Projects
- **python-template** — a starting point for Python projects with sensible defaults (linting, type checking, testing, CI/CD, and security scanning).  
- More small projects and tools will be published here over time.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Background
- **Languages:** Python, C, C++; learning Rust and Lua  
- **Cloud & Virtualization:** AWS, Azure, Docker, KVM/QEMU, libvirt, VMware ESXi  
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Ansible, Puppet, Terraform  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins  
- **Monitoring & Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana, Thanos  
- **Operating Systems:** Linux (RHEL, AlmaLinux, Rocky, Ubuntu)  
- **Other Interests:** LLMs (local inference, agents), embedded systems, retro hardware
